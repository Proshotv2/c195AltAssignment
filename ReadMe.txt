C195 from WGU Coursework

This java application is built for creating a calendar that can schedule appointments. Part of the functionality includes logging into a local db and running basic CRUD operations to authenticate. No security was taken into consideration on this project as it was meant to teach CRUD operations. 

This follows basic OOP standards with Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism in their simplest forms.


Author's Notes:

C195 is a course in which you can't get a ton of help starting out and everything/everyone wants you to watch a webinar until things click. This course took me quite a long time to figure out during the mess that is COVID-19. So a few things to help you understand my thought process behind the course and the code. 

I work in operations so it was easier for me to think about coding as scripting language. This tends to be a nasty downside in understanding the POJO framework and DAO's in particular. 

Fear not though, if you build your application from a functionality standpoint you will get through this. Start by adding to your frameworks and figuring out how stage switching work between your screens. This may seem basic but once you figure that out you'll have a frame of reference to work from. 

If your not familiar with models, views, Controllers you should research them quite heavily. Views are your FXML files. Controllers will dictate functionality on said views and the biggest challenge for me to overcome was the idea of a model. 
Models clicked for me when I started thinking of them in the same way I think of storage containers. It's simply there to help you contain data and access it easier. Build your models with a 1:1 relationship for what you need in the app and what is going into the database. Create as many as you need. The best way to learn is by trial and error. 

You'll notice as you look through the code that I have a scripting tendency to just use if-then statements to get the job done. This was the first skill I learned when scripting vbs and to this day I still struggle wanting to build in switch cases or finding a different way to do things. I highly suggest you always think about how you can recycle code and keep it as clean as possible. 

I hope this was helpful to someone, Cheers!
